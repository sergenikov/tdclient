TDDaemon (TDD) is interface between Todoist API and local TDclient. It implements
Pyro4 daemon and listens for clients.

Example of Normal Operation
---------------------------------
TDDaemon waits for a client to make a request such as what are todo items for
today. TDD contacts TD API to get requested information.

Design Questions
---------------------------------
- How does TDD register with TD API?
- Where does it store authentication information?
  - Does a user have to authenticate each time TDD starts?
  - Where is user information stored?
  - TODO: Research OAuth with TD API.


TDD Interface
----------------------------------
BASIC
- connect to TD API
- authenticate with TD API
- optional: get some default information from TD (e.g. todo today, etc)

EXTENSIONS
- have notifications about upcoming events
- respond to certain commands sent by the client


Config file
--------------------------------
Located in $HOME/.todoist. It holds three fields:
client_id: abcdefg123456
client_secret: abcdefg123456
access_token: abcdefg123456

Meant to add basic safety to this info so that they are not part of the code,
but I will try to come up with a better way (if there is one) to store this
information. Definitely not optimal.
